            My coding journey began in earnest in early 2023 with the release of Resident Evil 4 Remake. Previously, I had dabbled with JSON and XML files for
            modding purposes, but the RE4 Remake introduced me to Lua code, opening a whole new world of possibilities.

          <p>
            Determined to enhance my gaming experience, I dove into learning Lua and the intricacies of the RE Engine and REFramework. It was grueling work,
            especially with a development environment that was far from ideal. The process involved locating specific fields or properties within the game’s
            internal structure and writing scripts to access them. With no IDE debugging available, it was a relentless cycle of trial and (runtime) error.
            However, after successfully accessing the desired fields without any runtime errors, I felt a profound sense of achievement.

        <h2>Eventually, I Got Better</h2>

            As I continued to improve, fellow modders began seeking my help or commissioning me for projects. One notable challenge was creating a laser pointer
            mod for all the weapons in the game—a task that professional developers deemed impossible. I spent several months attempting to build a new laser
            system using the FX Components in the RE Engine, but ultimately, it proved unfeasible. Undeterred, I pivoted to a new approach, creating game
            objects to simulate the laser effect. This innovative solution earned me a reputation as one of the premier RE Engine mod developers.

            The release of Dragon's Dogma 2 in March 2024 marked another milestone in my modding career. This highly anticipated RE Engine game demanded more
            advanced technical skills. I wrote sophisticated hooks and internal logic to modify the dreaded Dragonsplague that affected players' pawns. This
            period of intense learning and development significantly boosted my coding and modding abilities, allowing me to revisit and improve my earlier RE4
            mods.

        <h2>The Decision</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            My growing expertise in modding sparked an interest in pursuing a career in software development. By the time I completed the Dragonsplague Cure
            mod, I was fully committed to this path. I applied to LaunchCode and was accepted! The skills I've gained thus far have me excited about my future
            in the industry, and I also have ambitious plans for further modding projects.
