            My coding journey began in earnest in early 2023, with the release of Resident Evil 4 Remake. I had worked with json and xml files for modding
            purposes previously, but when I began digging into the RE4 Remake, I found myself looking at Lua code.

            alt="An example of Lua code. It shows a function for accessing and caching the character's inventory in a video game."
          />
          <p>
            I decided that I really wanted to enjoy the game with several enhancements I had in mind, so I began learning Lua and the intricacies of the RE
            Engine and REFramework. It was extremely gruelling work, and the dev environment was particularly restricting. The general process was to find
            within the internal game structure a particular field or property I wanted to change, and then write a script to access it. There's no way to debug
            or test within an IDE, so it was near endless trial and (Runtime)error. After I successfully accessed the desired field without any runtime errors,
            it was time to try to set that field.

        <h2>Eventually, I Got Better</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Eventually, I started to get better, and other modders in the community began coming to me for help or with commissions. I even started working on a
            mod that professional developers told me was impossible. A mod that would add a laser pointer to all of the weapons in the game that do not support
            it. I spent several months trying to instantiate and build a new laser system using the FX Components in the RE Engine. This would prove impossible
            just as the pros told me, but I didn't give up. I started fresh with a new goal of instantiating new game objects to create a small cylinder and
            draw that from the weapons to the target, and using some of the built in settings for the textures, this created a perfect laser that I could draw
            from anywhere I wanted to any target point. Throughout the course of this mod, I began to learn about hooking, as this was required to draw some
            custom rays in the game to serve as the guide for how and where to draw the lasers. By the time I finished the Lasers mod, I somehow had a
            reputation as one of the premier RE Engine mod developers.

        <h2>Leveling Up</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Dragon's Dogma 2 released in March of 2024, and it was a highly anticipated RE Engine game. By this time, the more technical skills I touched on in
            previous mods became paramount with the new internal game structure of DD2. I had to write much more sophisticated hooks and internal logic to
            modify the dreaded Dragonsplague that players' pawns were susceptible to. This became a period of exponential growth in my coding and modding
            skills, and I would later return to some of my old RE4 mods with more tools in my belt to improve them.

        <h2>The Decision</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            I had been flirting with the idea of transitioning to a career in software development, and by the time I finished the Dragonsplague Cure mod, I was
            decided. I applied to LauchCode and got in! The skills I've gained already have me ecstatic at what my career might be like in the industry, and
            I've also got big plans for further work in modding!
